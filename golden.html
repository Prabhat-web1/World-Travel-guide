                <li>The Golden Temple, also known as Harmandir Sahib, is located in Amritsar, Punjab, India. It is one of the holiest and most significant religious sites for Sikhs worldwide.

                    <ol><li>Location:
                    Address: Golden Temple, Harmandir Sahib, Amritsar, Punjab, India.
                    
                    The temple is located at the center of Amritsar, and its stunning golden architecture is surrounded by a large artificial lake known as the Amrit Sarovar.</ol></li>
                <li>History:
                    <ul><li>The Golden Temple was founded by Guru Ram Das, the fourth Sikh Guru, in 1581. The construction of the temple was initiated by him, and the site was chosen near the holy tank of Amrit Sarovar.</li>
                    <li>The Golden Temple was later expanded and the Sarovar was constructed, with the temple being covered in gold in 1830 under the patronage of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the leader of the Sikh Empire.</li>
                    <li>The temple is a symbol of the Sikh philosophy of equality, and it is known for its openness to people of all religions, castes, and backgrounds.</li>
                    <li>Guru Granth Sahib, the holy scripture of Sikhism, is placed inside the temple and is continuously read aloud.</li>
                    The Golden Temple was attacked during Operation Blue Star in 1984 by the Indian Army, which aimed to remove Sikh militants from the temple. This event caused significant loss of life and damage to the temple, but it has since been restored.</li></ul>
